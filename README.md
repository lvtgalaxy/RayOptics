## Features
- Simulate various light sources: ray, parallel/divergent beam, and point source
- Simulate reflection in linear or curved mirrors, which can be defined by a custom equation
- Simulate beam splitters and dichroic mirrors
- Simulate refraction in linear or curved interfaces, which can be defined by a custom equation
- Simulate ideal lens/mirror, which obey the lens/mirror equation
- Simulate spherical lens defined by front/back focal distances
- Simulate gradient-index material defined by a custom refractive index function
- Simulate mixture of colors, color filtering, and chromatic dispersion
- Simulate diffraction gratings.
- View extensions of rays to see if they converge to a virtual image
- View real images, virtual images, and virtual objects directly
- View images that can be observed from some given position
- Distance, angular, energy flow, and momentum flow measurements
- Draw irradiance map and export as CSV data
- Export as SVG diagram
- Create modularized combinations of optical elements with custom parameters.
- Use the simulator as a node module in your own project.
